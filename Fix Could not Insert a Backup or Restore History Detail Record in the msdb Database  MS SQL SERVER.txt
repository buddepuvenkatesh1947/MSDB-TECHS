--ERROR
--Msg 3906, Level 16, State 1, Line 3
--Failed to update database "msdb" because the database is read-only.
--Msg 3009, Level 16, State 1, Line 3
--Could not insert a backup or restore history/detail record in the msdb database.
--This may indicate a problem with the msdb database. 
--The backup/restore operation was still successful.

--To Simulate the issue i am setting the MSDDB database to Read only mode...
USE [master]
GO
ALTER DATABASE [msdb] SET READ_ONLY WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE 
GO

--Take to Take back up of any database
BACKUP DATABASE DBA TO DISK = 'C:\DBA_Full.bak'

--Possible Reasons
--Backups are happening but Only logging is not happening into MSDB history tables 
--corruption in the database one of the reason... DBCC CheckDB will be helpfull
--Antivirus scanning the MDF file and thats the reason the sql server is not having permission of that drive.
--Permissions was removed on the msdb data file drive...
--insufficient memory or disk space
--Check error log for futher inputs...
--Exclusive Locks on MSDB Tables...
-->Rebuilding MSDB is the last option......

--Workaround\Solution:If you are ok with logging is not required then u can use
--below DBCC commands
DBCC TRACEON(3001,-1)
BACKUP DATABASE DBA TO DISK = 'C:\DBA_Full.bak'

--Clean UP The lab


USE [master]
GO
ALTER DATABASE [msdb] SET READ_WRITE WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE 
GO

---Second Demo:
--Disable the DBCC Trace off
DBCC TRACEOff(3001,-1)

--This will take exclusive lock
begin tran
update [msdb].[dbo].[restorehistory] with (tablock)
set replace = 1
Rollback
--Restore any database --this will get blocked and cancel the query and you will get an error
--that Could not insert a backup or restore history/detail
