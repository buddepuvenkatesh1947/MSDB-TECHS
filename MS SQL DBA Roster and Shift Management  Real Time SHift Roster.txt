Roster
In Our organization we used to send any planned leaves 10 days before it self via email.
We need to see the current month Roaster last week and need to Plan the Roster for next month.

We are having 3 shifts
Shifts	Starts 	Ends
First Shift		6.30 AM	3.30 PM
	General Shift	9 Am	6 PM
Second Shift 		1.30 PM	10 PM
	Evening shift 	6 PM	3.30 AM
Night Shit		10 PM	7 AM

•	Generally, we keep one lead…two senior data admins in Shift. Depending the workload adjustment will happen.
•	If no work is there in First shift, then they may ask to come in General shift so that the resource will be available up to 6 PM clock.
•	We used to send the roster 2 days before of month end.so adjustments can be done further if any.
