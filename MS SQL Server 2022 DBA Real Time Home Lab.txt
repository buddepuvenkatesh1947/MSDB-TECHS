Basics steps we need to check For Error Free installation
1. All Member servers should be part of the Domain
2. Firewall should be off 
3. Check communication between and Domain and member servers 
4. Check Nslookup for all servers (it means DNS is resolving hostname to IP and vice versa)
5. Login with Domain administrator or user which is having Domain Level Permissions every where

Step By step:
1. Enable Virtualization (VT) In BIOS
2. Install VMware workstation
3. Install 3 Windows Server OS 
4. Install VMware Tools [Environment Specific]
5. Disable IPv6 and configure IPs as shown in the demo environment Picture
6. Install Extra network adapter for node 2 & node 3 for heartbeat 
7. Install Active Directory and configure Forward Lookup and Reverse Lookup Zones in Domain OS.
8. Disable the password complexity policy in domain 
9. Disable the public, Private and domain firewalls rules in domain os.
10. Disable the public and private firewall rules in node 2 and node 3 
11. Join the Node 1 and node 2 to domain.
12. Disable the domain firewall rule in node 2 and node3
13. Install .Net 3.5 Framework in Node 1 & Node 2
14. Install ISCSI Target Server and create Virtual Hard disks in domain and Assign to Node 1 & Node 2
15. Connect to ISCSI Target through ISCSI Initiator and Assign Drive Letters (Note: Drive Letters Should and names should be same In Node 1 & Node 2)
16. Install Fail-over clustering Feature in Node 1 & Node 2
17. Install Fail-over Cluster Automation Server Feature in Node 1 &
 Node 2 
18. Install ssms in node1 and node2

21. Enable Always on feature On Both Standalone Instances in Node 1 & Node 2 and configure always on
22. Create and Validate Cluster
23. Install SQL failover cluster in node1 with (sql202201) 
24. Install SQL Server With add a node to cluster Option in Node2   {Note: This works as Active - Passive SQL Cluster}
25. Install SQL failover cluster in node1 with (sql202202) 
26. Install SQL Server With add a node to cluster Option in Node2   {Note: This works as Active - Active SQL Cluster}
