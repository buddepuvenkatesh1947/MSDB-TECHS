How to Build SQL Server 2019 DBA Real Time Home Lab in Azure

                    Dc                            Node1                     Node2
Private IP 10.1.1.4                     10.1.1.5                     10.1.2.4
Public IP 20.25.109.3              	20.163.146.250   		172.174.29.62
Cluster                                      10.1.1.50                    10.1.2.50
Cluster                                      10.1.1.100             10.1.2.100
Always on Listener IP              10.1.1.75                      10.1.2.75
Standalone Instance   NODE1\SQL2019HYD01 NODE2\SQL2019HYD02
Clustered Instance  SQLCLUSTER01\SQL201901 SQLCLUSTER02\SQL201902

Note:The above public ips are controlled by Azure itself.we dont have control on this.

Environment: Multi subnet Cluster
1. One windows server 2019 OS as Domain (ABC.com)
2. Another two windows Servers 2019 os as a member server.

Note: Building a real time home lab in azure is different when compared to on prem.
Previously we had VNN in cluster the VNN will have IP on active node however in place of VNN we are having DN.
In DNN Cluster will have IPs all Nodes participated in DNS. 
For Mutli subnet we don’t need Load balancer for listener. However it’s required for single subnet.
2. We can configure load balance if the participated VMs are in same available set or Zone 
Basics steps we need to check For Error Free installation
1. All Member servers should be part of the Domain
2. Firewall should be off (Domain, Public&Private)
3. Check communication between and Domain and member servers 
5. Login with Domain administrator or user which is having Domain Level Permissions every where
6. Some times you are unable to connect to instance when u try to connect from passive node. at that time u have need to add the respective series of cluster IPs in the IP configuration of respective nodes via azure portal.

Step By step:
1. Create a Resource group and Vnet with 2 subnets.
VNet:10.1.0.0/16
Subnet A: 10.1.1.0/24
Subnet B: 10.2.1.0/24
Deploy one windows server 2019 with name of DC in Subnet A and install active directory domain Services & DNS & iSCSI Target Server and do configure domain with ABC.com
2. Deploy two windows server 2019 OS with the names of Node1 & Node2
3. Node1 should be deployed in Subnet A and node2 is in Subnet B 
4. Add Domain Private IP address in Node1 & Node2 via Azure portal.
5. ADD all Servers into Multi desk for Easy administration(Optional)
6. Turn off the Domain, Public and Private firewall in Domain.
7. Turn off the Public, Private Firewall in Node1 & Node2.
8. Join the Node1 & Node2 into Domain.
9. Disable the domain firewall rules in Node1 & Node2.
10. Create Virtual Hard disks in domain and Assign to Node 1 & Node 2
11. Connect to ISCSI Target through ISCSI Initiator and Assign Drive Letters in Node 1 & 2 (Note: Drive Letters & Format & Allocation Should Be same In Node 1 & Node 2)
12. Install .Net 3.5, Failover cluster, failover cluster server automation in Node1 & Node2
13. Create and Validate Cluster by below powershell command instead of GUI
New-Cluster -Name winclu -Node node3,node5 -StaticAddress  10.1.1.25 ,10.1.2.25 -NoStorage -AdministrativeAccessPoint ActiveDirectoryAndDns -ManagementPointNetworkType Singleton
14. Install SQL failover cluster in node1 with (sql201901) 
15. Install SQL Server With add a node to cluster Option in Node2
{Note: This works as Active - Passive SQL Cluster}
16. Install SSMS in node1 and node2
17. Install SQL failover cluster Instance in node1 with (sql201902) 
18. Install SQL Server With add a node to cluster Option in Node2
{Note: This works as Active - Active SQL Cluster} (This is Optional)
19. Install Standalone SQL Server 2019 with sql2019hyd01 in node1
20. Install Standalone SQL Server 2019 with sql2019hyd02 in node2
21. Enable Always on feature On Both Standalone Instances in Node 1 & Node 2 and configure always on
22. Restore Any Sample Databases like Adventure works or North wind for Replication Practical
23. Configure Log shipping, Mirroring & Transactional Replication.

Finally we build the real time home lab and when you want to do any issue u can test in you lab and implement accordingly.
